# This is ye olde personal site. It's a React/Redux job with a touch of Bootstrap and custom CSS.

Now I know what you're thinking, "React/Redux for a personal site?! Can you say heavy-handed?"

Yes, I can. This was mostly to just practice the Redux flow and the build patterns.

This is a work in progress. As I add more projects and try out new things on the site, it'll evolve and blossom into a 
beautiful unicorn. 

Anywho, thanks for checking it out!
